## Photoshoot planning application, frontend
Frontend codes of Academy Java bootcamp final project, an application for photoshoot planning. This app allows one to create a photoshoot plan with detailed description, date and time information and reference pictures. It also shows sun position on a map at chosen time, which is a helpful tool in checking a possibility for shadows/sunlight. Plans can also be converted into pdf.

#### Frontend execution
Frontend is done using React. As a style we used Material UI solutions. Suncalc, Mapbox, React.pdf and moment.js were also utilized.

#### To run the show:
```
npm install
npm start
```

My own role: pdf creation, creation of new plan, modifying an existing plan
